# Roadmap

Objective for V2 is to flesh the game out, with a basic representation of the core game mechanics.

Off track, this will include car development, sponsorship deals and engine/tyre suppliers. A basic representation of contract negotiation for drivers and senior staff will be added.

On track, extra details in the races will be added, such as crashes and driver mistakes.
