# Contributing

If interested in contributing to the game, see below a list of areas that would be very useful to get some help on.

I suggest reading the "Roadmap", as I want to emphasise that the initial goal (version V1.0) is to build a very simple game.

# General Contribution to Code

Contact me if you have python experience and are interested in contributing directly to the code.

# General Advice

I am not a professional developer or game designer, so feel free to offer any general advice if you have experience in those domains.

## UI / Flet

The UI is built using Flet. I am quite knew to using flet, so any advice/suggestions will be welcome on the UI.

## Load Save

I have yet to decide how to implement load/save features in the game. Any suggestions would be welcome on this.

## Game Logic / Algorithims

There will be several areas in the game where some sort of algorthim will be required to determine AI events. Any suggestions on these would be welcome;

For V1.0, I do intend to have drivers swapping teams. Need an algorthim that keeps these realistic, so Schumacher does not end up at the worst team for example.

## Roster

The roster is located in the "src\1998_Roster" folder. This will need to be populated with drivers, tracks, head designers and commercial managers.
